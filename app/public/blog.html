          <h2>A Compilation of My Adventures, Mishaps, and Advice
            I received throughout my career transition into Tech</h2>
          <p>If you're reading this, you probably understand that transitioning
          into a tech career from a different field is HARD (or you'll probably
          understand that soon). This blog started as my way of pulling together
          all my realizations, misadventures, and amazing advice I've
          received from industry professionals. My hope now is that by publishing
          some of the wisdom I've gained (with permission, of course), it may help
          someone else in their career transition.</p>
          <p>I graduated with a STEM degree, and from there I tried on many different
          roles to find my fit before I even knew what software engineering was.
          Now, as a coding bootcamp graduate, I'm seeking a job. It's a
          challenging process. There are literally listings for jobs requiring
          more years of experience with a framework than the framework's existed for.
          Add that to rigorous 4-5 step interviews and the ever-changing landscape of LinkedIn
          guidelines, and you've got your work cut out for you.
          To me, the part that's always felt easy (and is
          by far my favorite) has been getting to meet people and listen to their
          stories and advice. Everyone I've met has been incredibly generous with
          their time and wisdom, and now I'm thrilled to share that with you, reader. So let's dive in!</p>
